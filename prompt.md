## Prompt

I want to create an MCP server for my team based on this tool:
https://github.com/zilliztech/claude-context

I want to use local services hosted in docker containers. A local MILVUS database to store the embeddings and a local Ollama instance for computing the embeddings. I should be able to configure a working MCP server based on the following configuration:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "claude-context": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "@zilliz/claude-context-mcp@latest"],
            "env": {
                "EMBEDDING_PROVIDER": "Ollama",
                "MILVUS_ADDRESS": "127.0.0.1:19530",
                "OLLAMA_HOST": "http://127.0.0.1:11434",
                "OLLAMA_MODEL": "nomic-embed-text",
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This git repo should contain the following:

- A README.md how to setup and run the MILVUS database locally on the system
- A README.md how to setup and run OLLAMA locally on the system, and on how to download the nomic-embed-text model
- Both for Windows and Linux
- Automation scripts to execute the instructions so that everything works out-of-the-box. This may involve docker scripts if needed or just simple commands to pull and run existing docker containers. Create Dockerfiles based on the default open-source ones if specific configuration items need to be set in the local docker instance.
- The above MCP configuration snippet and instructions on how to add it to VS Code
- Instructions on how to index code bases and use the MCP once everything is setup and running

The solution should be fully self-contained. Developers should only have to clone this repo, run the setup scripts, add the MCP and it should be fully functional using local deployment.
